gohttpd is a small, static files only, web server.

It features low resource usage and a single threaded design. It runs
on Linux and the BSDs. It has some advanced features such as
sendfile() under Linux and FreeBSD, persistent connections, and is
configurable.

If a directory does not have an index.html file, it will display a
listing of the files in the directory.

It is meant to run from a chroot jail. There are only a couple of
gotchas. The first being if you want to rotate the logs, the logs must
be inside the jail. For my website (seanm.ca) I have chroot-dir set to
/var/www and the following directory layout:

/var/www
|-- logs
\-- seanm.ca

You also have to keep all the files in the jail, no links to files
outside the jail.
